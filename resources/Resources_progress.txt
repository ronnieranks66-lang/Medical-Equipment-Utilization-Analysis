Resources Required Progress Log
===============================

Stage 1: Data Resources
- Synthetic dataset representing hospital medical equipment usage:
  - Raw file: data/raw/medical_equipment_utilization_synthetic.csv
  - Cleaned file: data/processed/medical_equipment_utilization_synthetic_cleaned(in).csv
- Supporting analysis files:
  - EDA workbook: analysis/exploratory_analysis/EDA.xlsx
  - ROI workbook: analysis/roi_calculations/ROI.xlsx
  - Utilization workbook: analysis/utilization_metrics/Utilization data.xlsx

Stage 2: Software & Libraries
- Core language and environment:
  - Python 3.8+ (recommended).
- Python libraries:
  - Data & computation: pandas, numpy.
  - Visualization (static): matplotlib, seaborn.
  - Visualization (interactive): plotly.
  - Dashboards: dash, jupyter-dash.
- Optional tooling:
  - Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab or VS Code with Python & Jupyter extensions.

Stage 3: Hardware & Infrastructure
- Local machine with:
  - At least 8 GB RAM recommended for comfortable data analysis.
  - Sufficient disk space for datasets and notebook outputs.
- Execution environment:
  - Local Python environment (venv or conda) or equivalent managed environment.

Stage 4: Project Structure & Documentation
- Folder structure to organize resources:
  - data/raw and data/processed for datasets.
  - analysis/ for EDA, utilization, and ROI notebooks/workbooks.
  - dashboard/ for dashboard-related documentation and screenshots.
  - presentation/ for slide decks and narrative summaries.
  - documentation/ for progress logs and project notes (including this file).

Stage 5: Human & Process Resources
- Skills required:
  - Data analysis with Python (pandas, numpy).
  - Basic to intermediate data visualization skills.
  - Familiarity with medical equipment context and hospital operations (for interpretation).
- Processes:
  - Iterative EDA and validation of metrics.
  - Review cycles with stakeholders (operations, finance, clinical leadership) to interpret results.
