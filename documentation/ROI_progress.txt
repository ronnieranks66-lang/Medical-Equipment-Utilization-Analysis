ROI Analysis Progress Log
=========================

Stage 1: Data Preparation
- Reused cleaned dataset from processed CSV with standardized column names.
- Ensured currency fields (Procedure_Revenue, Daily_Operating_Cost, Net-Profit (daily)) were numeric.

Stage 2: Metric Definition
- Defined core financial metrics:
  - Total Revenue (sum of Procedure_Revenue).
  - Total Operating Cost (sum of Daily_Operating_Cost).
  - Total Net Profit (sum of Net-Profit (daily)).
- Defined ROI and profitability KPIs:
  - ROI (%) = Net Profit / Operating Cost * 100.
  - Profit Margin (%) = Net Profit / Revenue * 100.
  - Average Profit per Day = Net Profit / number of observed days.
  - Average Profit per Procedure (where used) = Net Profit / total procedures.

Stage 3: Aggregation
- Computed financial and ROI metrics:
  - By Equipment_Type.
  - By Department.
  - By Month (for temporal patterns, where needed).

Stage 4: ROI Visualizations
- Built plotting notebooks to:
  - Compare ROI (%) by equipment type and department.
  - Compare average profit per day by equipment type and department.
  - Highlight high-ROI vs low-ROI assets for decision-making.

Stage 5: ROI Dashboards
- Integrated ROI views into dashboard notebooks and Plotly/Dash-based tabs for interactive exploration.
