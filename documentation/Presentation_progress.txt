- Saved initial narrative in the `presentation` folder (later superseded by slide-focused content).

Stage 2: Slide Deck Outline
- Created a structured slide deck in markdown:
  - File: presentation/Medical_Equipment_Utilization_Slides.md

  - Each slide includes a clear title and bullet points suitable for PowerPoint/Google Slides.

Stage 3: Content Coverage
- Ensured slides cover:
  - Project objectives and scope.
  - Data and methodology.
  - EDA highlights and utilization metrics.
  - Financial and ROI analysis.
  - Dashboards, use cases, and decision support.

  - Directly copied into a presentation tool, or
  - Converted via markdown-to-slides tooling if desired.
- Designed to be understandable without deep technical background, suitable for mixed audiences.
