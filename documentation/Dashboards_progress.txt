Dashboards & Visualization Progress Log
=======================================

Stage 1: Static Visualization Setup
- Created Matplotlib/Seaborn-based notebooks for:
  - EDA (distributions, scatter plots, categorical bar charts).
  - Utilization metrics by equipment type, department, and month.
  - ROI and profitability comparisons by equipment type and department.

Stage 2: Plotly Notebook Dashboards
- Built Plotly-based notebooks to provide interactive charts for:
  - EDA (utilization distributions, hours relationships, record counts).
  - ROI (ROI %, margins, and profit-per-day).
  - Utilization (rates and procedures by type/department/month).

Stage 3: Integrated Multi-Tab Dashboard
- Implemented a multi-page (tabbed) dashboard using JupyterDash/Dash:
  - EDA tab: key exploratory charts and distributions.
  - ROI tab: ROI and financial KPIs by equipment type and department.
  - Utilization tab: utilization rates and volumes across time and organizational units.
- Linked all tabs to the same cleaned dataset and aggregated tables for consistency.

Stage 4: Deployment Mode
- Configured the Dash app to run inline in Jupyter/VS Code via `app.run_server(mode="inline")` for easy local use.
- Documented required Python packages (pandas, numpy, plotly, dash, jupyter-dash).
