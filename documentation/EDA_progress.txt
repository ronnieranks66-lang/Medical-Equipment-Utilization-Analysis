EDA Progress Log
================

Stage 1: Data Ingestion
- Loaded processed dataset from: data/processed/medical_equipment_utilization_synthetic_cleaned(in).csv
- Standardized column names and confirmed core fields (Date, Equipment_ID, Equipment_Type, Department, utilization and financial columns).

Stage 2: Data Cleaning
- Converted date field to datetime.
- Cast utilization metrics and procedure counts to numeric.
- Cleaned currency fields by removing 'KES', spaces, and commas, then converted to numeric.
- Dropped completely empty columns, if any.

Stage 3: Exploratory Analysis
- Generated descriptive statistics for utilization and financial metrics.
- Reviewed distributions of Available_Hours, Actual_Operating_Hours, Utilization_Rate, and Number_of_Procedures.
- Analyzed categorical distributions for Equipment_Type, Department, Day_of_Week, and Month.

Stage 4: EDA Visualizations
- Created visualization notebooks (Matplotlib/Seaborn and Plotly versions) to:
  - Plot histograms and density plots for utilization metrics.
  - Visualize Available vs Actual Operating Hours.
  - Show record counts by equipment type and department.

Stage 5: EDA Dashboard (Concept)
- Designed EDA dashboard views inside notebooks to summarize core utilization and distribution insights.
